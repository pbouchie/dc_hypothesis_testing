This workspace comprises the results of my analysis on a excersize dataset to answer the following questions:
   
    Determine if the proportion of adverse effects differs significantly between the Drug and Placebo groups, saving the p-value as a variable called two_sample_p_value.

    Find out if the number of adverse effects is independent of the treatment and control groups, saving as a variable called num_effects_p_value containing a p-value.

    Examine if there is a significant difference between the ages of the Drug and Placebo groups, storing the p-value of your test in a variable called age_group_effects_p_value.
